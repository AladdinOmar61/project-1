----BETCH: Choose Between a Matching or Betting Card Game! ("BETCH-a can't beat both games first try!")----
Page opens to a screen which asks you which two card games you want to play: matching or higher-or-lower?

--MATCHING GAME--
Pick two cards of the same number (suit doesnt matter) and find its match with an array of 15 cards (3x5) **one card will be a joker card in which once its clicked, does not need a match and counts as a match* you also have only 30 seconds to complete the puzzle (time may change after some testing).

--HIGHER OR LOWER?--
One card will show up along with a prompt asking you if you think the next card will be higher or lower than the current one you see. I you guess correctly, then you get a point, if you guess incorrectly, you lose a point. If you have 13 or more points by the time all 52 cards have been shown/flipped, you win. Otherwise, game over!

--API--
I am using the playing cards API, and I plan to use it for creating, shuffling and drawing cards from a deck.
--API SAMPLES-- 
- Shuffle a deck of cards: https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle/?deck_count=1
- Drawing a card: https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/draw/?count=1

--FEATURES REQUIRED--
- a timer
- an array of cards
- a score tracker
- an array of cards
- an image of a card with two buttons to place your bet

--STRETCH GOALS-- (* = priority stretch goal)
- an animated title screen
- a whole winning screen (instead of an alert for example)
- confetti effects for the wining screen
- adding a joker card to high-low game (joker will have the highest value in this game) that gives you a chance to redeem more points somehow(idea still WIP)
- add a card flipping animation
- red highlight around card if incorrect guess, green for correct
